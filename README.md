# Testing: SuperTextMesh
This repo is going to contain different examples/code to use with [SuperTextMesh](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/gui/super-text-mesh-57995). No source code from [SuperTextMesh](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/gui/super-text-mesh-57995) will be included.

## What is SuperTextMesh?

To quote [their marketplace description](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/gui/super-text-mesh-57995): 

    "Super Text Mesh is a powerful, easy-to-use text renderer that replaces Unity's built-in Text Mesh and UI Text components!"

Some features it includes are:
- Text Entrance Animations
- Text Exit Animations
- Sound Effect Handling
- Text Emphasis
- And a whole lot more!

This will enable me to create polished and fun text within my personal game project [PaperRocket](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-gHQyJWCEI). Saving me time, and allowing me to focus on more features and story.

## Why Make This A Public Repo?
With a quite a bit of google searching I could not find a lot of documentation (Short of the creator's [website](http://kaiclavier.com/docs/SuperTextMesh.html), which is an amazing resource). Which is a shame because this product is really well written and looks stunning. 

I love to have people who are interested in this asset be able to get started right away with some interesting/helpful code to model off of.
